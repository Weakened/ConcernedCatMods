# Pre-release smoke test — Concerned Cartographer v1.0

The single-session human release checklist. This document accumulates every
manual-only verification deferred by the autonomous conveyor (OPS-001
rev 2) from v0.3 onward and is finalized against the exact v1.0 RC. Rows
marked **BLOCKS** must pass before publication; others are record-and-ship.

> Status: LIVING DOCUMENT — grows each sprint; the RC identity section is
> filled in when the final package is built.

## 0. RC identity (filled at final packaging)

- Version: _pending_
- RC commit: _pending_
- ZIP path: _pending_
- ZIP SHA-256: _pending_
- Package audit: ZIP root = manifest.json, README.md, CHANGELOG.md,
  LICENSE, icon.png (256×256), plugins/TheConcernedCat.ConcernedCartographer.dll
  and nothing else. **BLOCKS**

## 1. Fresh install and lifecycle

| # | Setup | Action | Expected | Evidence on failure | Blocks |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Fresh mod-manager profile | Import RC ZIP via "Import local mod"; dependencies auto-install; Start modded | Game reaches menu; log shows the version banner with real Valheim/BepInEx/Jötunn versions and the effective config | LogOutput.log | Yes |
| 1.2 | 1.1 | Enter a disposable world; open/close map repeatedly; logout to menu; re-enter | No exceptions, no stale overlay references, atlas ready line logged | LogOutput.log | Yes |

## 2. Roads (v0.1–v0.2 regressions)

| # | Setup | Action | Expected | Evidence on failure | Blocks |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | Any world | Walk a dirt path and a paved road | Distinct dark dirt/paved lines appear; re-walking never thickens or grows them | Map screenshot + sidecar size | Yes |
| 2.2 | Hoe + stonecutter | Place pathen/paved pieces without walking | Ink appears immediately; leveling/raising ground adds NO ink | Clip | Yes |
| 2.3 | Recorded road | Cultivate/reset over part of it; pave over a dirt stretch | Covered ink vanishes; kind converts without doubles | Before/after screenshots | Yes |
| 2.4 | Recorded roads | `cc_roads delete` then `cc_roads rebuild` | Road returns from terrain paint; unexplored regions stay empty | Log + screenshot | Yes |
| 2.5 | Console | Run the cc_roads operation set (status/kind/hide/unhide/split/join/undo) | Summaries correct; map updates; undo reverts | Console screenshot | No |

## 3. Pin Workbench (v0.3)

| # | Setup | Action | Expected | Evidence on failure | Blocks |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | World with several vanilla pins | Hover one on the large map, press the workbench hotkey (default P) | Adopt prompt opens; Close leaves the pin completely untouched | Screenshot | Yes |
| 3.2 | 3.1 | Adopt, then edit every field (name, icon, category, color, size, notes, tags, status, crossed-off, scope) and Apply | Pin identity/position unchanged; visible name/icon update on the map; one `cc_pins undo` reverts the whole edit | Screenshot + `cc_pins status` | Yes |
| 3.3 | 3.2 | Restart the game, reopen the world | Every edited field persists; NO duplicate pin appears; `cc_pins status` shows the same counts | Screenshot + pins.tsv | Yes |
| 3.4 | Managed pin | Cross it off and delete another via vanilla map UI | Cross-off appears in workbench state; vanilla deletion shows in `cc_pins deleted` as a tombstone; `restore` brings it back | Console output | Yes |
| 3.5 | Two similar pins ~10 m apart | `cc_pins dups` then `merge confirm` | Preview first; merged pin keeps notes + provenance line; undo separates again | Console output | No |
| 3.6 | Death/bed/boss/another mod's pin | Hotkey on it; try any cc_pins operation nearby | Read-only panel; no operation ever alters it | Screenshot | Yes |
| 3.7 | ~50+ adopted/created pins | `cc_pins adoptall confirm`, batch `cc_pins category`, map browsing | Responsive UI, no errors, one-step undo works | Console output | No |
| 3.8 | Profile with the mod removed | Launch vanilla after using pins | All managed pins remain as ordinary vanilla pins with names/icons/positions/cross-offs | Screenshot | Yes |
| 3.9 | Panel open | Resolution sanity at 1080p and 1440p/ultrawide | Panel fits, vanilla map controls (pin bar, toggles) stay reachable | Screenshots | No |

## 4. World isolation and persistence

| # | Setup | Action | Expected | Evidence on failure | Blocks |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | Two worlds A and B | Record roads + pins in A; switch to B; return to A | B shows none of A's data; A restores everything | Sidecar listing | Yes |
| 4.2 | Mid-session | Kill the game process (Task Manager) shortly after edits | On next launch the journal recovers to the last flushed state; log shows the recovery line | LogOutput.log | Yes |

## 5–13. Later-sprint sections

Placeholders grow as sprints complete: Atlas Drawer/search/views (v0.4),
routes (v0.5), multiplayer/tombstones (v0.6), NoMap/controller/
localization/accessibility (v0.7), compatibility/import-export/backup
(v0.8), migration/upgrade/beta items (v0.9), final performance-feel and
Thunderstore preflight (v1.0).
